You can save a lot of money by avoiding credit‑based AI app builders like Lovable/Replit/V0 and instead using a normal code editor (like VS Code) wired to AI tools you already pay for (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.). This gives you more control, better scalability, and you only pay one subscription instead of stacking multiple expensive SaaS plans.​​

Why no‑code AI builders get expensive
Tools like Lovable charge fixed “credits” for actions (generate page, add auth, edit UI, etc.), which makes it hard to see the real dollar cost of each change.​

Replit and V0 show usage directly in dollars, and for similar prompts their costs can be noticeably higher or lower than each other, which adds unpredictability as you iterate.​

Building anything beyond simple prototypes (auth, dashboards, multiple pages) quickly burns through credits so you end up needing at least the Pro plans ($20–25+/month) just to make progress.​

Use tools you already pay for
If you already have ChatGPT Plus or Claude Pro/Max, you can plug them into your editor (VS Code) via extensions like OpenAI Codex-style extensions or Claude Code, which are included in those subscriptions or available as relatively cheap plans.​

This means you pay once for the AI model and reuse it across your coding workflow instead of paying separate per‑platform “AI” fees in each builder.​

VS Code + AI instead of Lovable/Replit
VS Code itself is free and works on all major platforms, and its extension marketplace lets you add AI coding helpers (Claude Code, OpenAI-based extensions, Copilot, Cursor-like tools) without extra “credit” layers from no‑code platforms.​

With an AI coding extension, you can:

Generate full projects from prompts

Let the agent install dependencies and tooling

Iteratively refine code, run locally, and deploy on cheap hosting, all under your control and without extra app‑builder markups.​

Practical money‑saving strategy for you
Given you already build SaaS and handle infra:

Use VS Code or Cursor‑style IDE locally; avoid Lovable/Replit/V0 for anything beyond quick experiments.​

Keep a single main AI subscription (e.g., Claude Pro/Max or ChatGPT Plus) and use it via editor extensions and/or API for your projects.​

Self‑host your apps on low‑cost infra (Render, Fly.io, cheap VPS, or your existing cloud stack) so you pay commodity infra instead of “AI app builder” premiums.​
